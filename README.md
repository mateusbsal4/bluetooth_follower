# bluetooth_follower
This repo hosts the arduino code for a line following and bluetooth controlled robot manufactured at USP. Its ultimate goal was, in a competition
 held at Escola Politecnica da USP, to collect as many objects as possible in a 2 minute period and place them in the proper containers in an environment that simulates a landfill.
The hardware consists of an Arduino Uno shield, a 13V and 1,3Ah battery, two servomotors, two DC motors, two infrared sensors, a bluetooth module and H bridge driver.
The mechanical structure was entirely devised by myself and my colleagues at USP.
It was programmed to work autonomously for an initial time period and then be controlled by bluetooth. 
Videos below show the line following and bluetooth modes of operation.
