# bluetooth_follower
This repo hosts the arduino code for a line following and bluetooth controlled robot manufactured at USP. Its ultimate goal was, in a competition
 held at Escola Politecnica da USP, to collect as many objects as possible in 2 minutes and place them in the proper containers in an environment that simulates a landfill.
The hardware consists of an Arduino Uno shield, two servomotors, two DC motors, a bluetooth module and H bridge driver.
The mechanical structure was entirely devised by myself and my colleagues at USP.
